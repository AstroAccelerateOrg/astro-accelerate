# **Single Pulse Search**

Single pulse search consists from several stages, currently these are: calculation of standard deviation, SPDT and peak-finding. The description of how is mean and standard deviation calculated by AA is [here](https://github.com/AstroAccelerateOrg/astro-accelerate/wiki/Calculation-of-mean-and-standard-deviation-in-AA). 

We have implemented single pulse search algorithm which is rely on combination of boxcar filters of different widths and decimation of time-domain data in time. The algorithm we have used is configurable and could be adjusted to for speed or sensitivity. Sensitivity for currently used configuration is shown below. The figure shows two limits for the algorithm: R-SNRmax is best possible SNR recovered; R-SNRmin worst possible SNR recovered.
