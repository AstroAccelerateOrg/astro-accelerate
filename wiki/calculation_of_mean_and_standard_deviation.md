# **Calculation of mean and standard deviation**

Calculation of mean and standard deviation (Stdev) is used in many places within AstroAccelerate (single pulse search, acceleration search, periodicity search). For our GPU implementation of standard deviation we have used a streaming algorithm by T. F. Chan 1983 which is using pair-wise summation for better numerical stability. We have also implemented optional point-wise outlier rejection which attempts to find true value of standard deviation of the underlying background noise or base level noise by removing points which are above used given multiple of standard deviation _n_. You can switch outlier rejection on by enabling _baselinenoise_ in input text file, value of _n_ is given by _sigma_constant_ parameter also in input text file.

For single pulse search module we also require values of mean and standard deviation for time-series after we apply a boxcar filter (running sum) of given length. Since calculation of standard deviation for every boxcar length used in single pulse search is expensive, we only calculate values of standard deviation for time-series decimated in time (DIT), i.e. we calculate standard deviation only for boxcar filter of width equal to a powers of two. We then interpolate values of standard deviation for all required boxcar widths.
