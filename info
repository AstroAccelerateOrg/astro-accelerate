get_recorder_data is out of the library. 

Now the code works this way:

main.cpp:
	- load files
	- allocate cpu memory for input files
	- call library 

library: 
	- init gpu
	- do stratagy
	- allocate cpu memory for output files
	- allocate gpu memory 
	- do all the operations needed

Next step is now to write the output of the SPS outside of the library. 
The host should take care of this
